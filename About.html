        <h1>Justin Yee</h1>
        <p>My name is Justin Yee, I am currently in the 9th grade attending Lowell High School. I think the website can be a big help to undocumented students, because it can help them pay for school or other opportunities that they might have been able to afford without having to be documented. It can be a big help because a green card and obtaining citizenship can be hard, so having something that doesn’t require being documented that can benefit you can be helpful.</p>

        <div class="ernesto">
        <h1>Ernesto Araújo</h1>
        <p>I am an immigrant from Él Salvador. I am in the 10th grade and I currently attend San Francisco International High School. I think this website will help many undocumented students that want to study more but  don’t have the resources to pay for college.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="josev">
        <h1>Jose Vasquez</h1>
        <p>I think this website can benefit students without documentation because there are a lot of good scholarships that don’t require a social security number or green card. There are some applications that require you to be eligible for DACA, but most of them don’t require anything, just applying. I know some friends that aren’t applying to Universities because they don’t have knowledge about this opportunities, which is why our team decided to make this website.</p>

        <div class="joser">
        <h1>Jose Rodriguez</h1>
            <p>I'm an undocumented immigrant student from Nochistlan, Zacatecas, a small town in Mexico. The small town was affected by Mexico's violent drug war. My parents saw that there was no opportunities for me or my brother. We left family behind and immigrated to California. I need accessible scholarships so that I’ll be able to afford my education.

        <div class="andrea">
        <h1>Andrea Ayala</h1>
            <p>I am from El Salvador and I have lived in San Francisco for about 9 years. I hadn't been affected by my undocumentation status until junior year when we had to start thinking about colleges. I really found making this website helpful for me and other people in the near future.</p>
